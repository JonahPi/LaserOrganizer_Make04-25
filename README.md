# 🔧 Laser Organizer for ESP32 – Smarte Werkstattboxen Add-on

The **Laser Organizer** is an extension to the [Smarte Werkstattboxen project](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2023/5/2317908275419508878) published in the German *Make Magazin* (Issue 5/2023).

It enhances the functionality of the original system by adding laser-controlled automation using a compact, modular hardware platform.
